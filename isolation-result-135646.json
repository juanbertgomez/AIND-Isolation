Test functionality of MinimaxPlayer.minimax()\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssertionError: False is not true : Your MinimaxAgent.minimax function did not visit every node in the game tree as player 1.  First check for off-by-one errors in your handling of the depth limiting. Then, especially if the number of nodes explored by your agent is too low, check everywhere you call to game.get_legal_moves() to make sure you are getting the legal moves for the appropriate player at each level of the game tree.  Finally, you may be using non-standard search optimizations that are not supported by the test cases.  The range of expansions accepted will vary slightly within the range indicated based on your termination condition.\n\nExpected number of visited nodes -- min: 7 max: 7\nNumber of nodes your agent explored: 56\n\nTest Case Details:\n------------------\nHeuristic: open_move_score\nDepth limit: 1\nInitial Board State:\n     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8\n0  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | \n1  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | \n2  |   |   |   |   |   | - |   |   |   | \n3  |   |   |   | - | - |   |   |   |   | \n4  |   |   | 2 | - | - |   |   |   |   | \n5  |   |   | - |   |   | - |   |   |   | \n6  |   |   | - |   |   | 1 |   |   |   | \n7  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | \n8  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | \n\ngame._board_state:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 22, 51]\n\n\n\nFailed Test: 7.
